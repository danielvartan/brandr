## R CMD Check Results (See 'Test Environments')

There were 0 ERRORs and 0 WARNINGs.

There were 2 NOTEs.

### Note 1

```
Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:
    yml (2:46, 14:11)
```

This is a false positive. The word 'yml' refers to the YAML file format.

### Note 2

```
The Title field should be in title case. Current version is:
‘Brand Identity Management Using brand.yml Standard’
In title case that is:
‘Brand Identity Management Using Brand.yml Standard’
```

This is a false positive. The title is correct as is, since 'brand.yml'
(in lowercase) is the name of the standard.
